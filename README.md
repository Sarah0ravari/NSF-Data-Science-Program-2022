## Project Description
Our goal is to turn data into information, and information into Insight. We are going to explore data quality, description, shape, patterns, 
relationships, and visualizing it for better understanding. We will go through a fun ride of plotting cool graphs, piechart, 
finding out the best games, publishers, critic scores, etc.

## Needs of this project

- data exploration/descriptive statistics
- data processing/cleaning
- statistical modeling
- writeup/reporting
